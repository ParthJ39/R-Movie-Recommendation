# R-Movie-Recommendation
## **Project Description:**
Recommendation systems play an important role in e-commerce and online streaming services, such as Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon. 
Making the right recommendation for the next product, music or movie increases user retention and satisfaction, leading to sales and profit growth. 
A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. 
The principal objective of this R programming project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users based on certain selected features from the dataset. 
The recommendation process can be fine-tuned by choosing the appropriate algorithm that fits the dataset and is less prone to error. 
The selection of the dataset should be based on users, user rating, title and it should have sufficiently large records of data for the given feature.
